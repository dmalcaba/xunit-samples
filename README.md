# xunit-samples

This project is a colletion of sample usages for using the xunit test framework. The sample you see hear were taken from different sources, such as blogs, stackoverflow, and the main xunit project page, and compiled them so I can easily reference back to it if needed.

It is not complete but it will take care of the most common requirements for creating tests.

This project targets .NET Core 3.0
